# Overview of a 3-Tier Architecture <a name="overview"></a>
when the user wants to access any application, it needs the UI to interact, User Interface is called as presentation layer. Once the user started accessing the UI, application needs to respond to the user according to the business need. So the Business logic operations happens at business layer. Finally, application needs some kind of persistent storage to interact with user, This layer is called as data layer.

Three Layers are
  Presentation Layer [UI]
  Business Layer [Business logic]
  Data Layer [Data]

**Why we need three tier application ?** <a name="3tier"></a>
  If you look at the above points, we are separating the application into multiple layer which helps to scale and secure independently and main modularity . These layers are physically separated, with each running on its own infrastructure.

  The architecture presented in this article is one of many possible ways to design a three-tier system and is specifically tailored to meet the goals of availability, security, scalability, and performance.
    
  In this article, We will build Secure, Scalable and Resilient 3-tiered Web application in AWS Cloud.


Let's Start building it!

**Why we need it ?**
AWS by default provides the default VPC, but if you are creating the resources or running your workload in default VPC, your application might get access to external world and it's not safe to build the application in default VPC.

In order to protect your resources, you will be building your own network space in cloud and you will be having the control such as inbound and outbound traffic for the VPC.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# VPC COMPONENTS:
what is subnets ?
Subnet is network portion in your VPC, just think VPC is the full pizza and subnet is one slice of complete pizza.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba3b1e08-4c4d-4d16-8639-1549b96be3de)


**why we need subnet ?**
  We can create the network portion in VPC such as private and public subnets and we can set the rules such as only the resources in the public subnet can access the internet and resources in private subnet shouldn't access it.
  
**Internet gateway : [IGW]**
  It is the one of the AWS component in VPC, with the help of IGW, your VPC can access to the internet. So, without creating and attaching the IGW to VPC, your VPC can't access to the internet world.
  
**NAT Gateway : [NAT GW]**
  It is the one of the AWS component in VPC. NAT GW helps private instance resources to talk to internet. For Ex., Your private instances need to get the patch, in this case your private resources will talk with internet via NAT gateway. NAT Gateway will be present in Public subnet and acts as a proxy for your private instances.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 1: CREATE VPC 
<a name="CreateVPC"></a>
  As this article is quite big to follow up, I have created the VPC and its component in the other article which is mentioned below. Please refer the below mentioned article and come back here to create the Security groups.

https://medium.com/@tojanasg/aws-build-a-secure-scalable-and-resilient-3-tier-web-application-c763a2a3ebb6

## Security Groups Configuration:**
Security Groups are virtual firewalls for controlling inbound and outbound traffic for your EC2 instances.

1. **Web Server-SG (for the Web Server):**

1.Navigate to Security Groups in the VPC Dashboard.
2.Click Create Security Group.
3.Name: WebServer-SG.

**Inbound Rules:**

  HTTP (80): Allow from 0.0.0.0/0 (or your IP range).
  HTTPS (443): Allow from 0.0.0.0/0.
  SSH (22): Allow from your IP address only (to enable EC2 Instance Connect).
  
**Outbound Rules: Allow all traffic (default).**
  Attach this security group to your EC2 Web Server instance later.

2. **AppServer-SG (for the Application Server):**
Repeat the process for another security group.
Name: AppServer-SG.

Inbound Rules:
  Allow HTTP (port 5000 or custom app port) traffic from WebServer-SG.
  Outbound Rules: Allow all traffic.

**3. Database-SG (for RDS):**
Create a new security group named Database-SG.

**Inbound Rules:**
  MySQL/Aurora (3306): Allow traffic only from AppServer-SG.
  Outbound Rules: Allow all traffic (default).

**Outcome**
  A VPC with the following configuration:
  Public Subnet: Hosts your Web Server.
  Private Subnet: Hosts your App Server and RDS.

**If you have noticed, we have created the security group chaining, Security group of App Server only allows traffic from webserver. SG of Database will allow traffic from App Server. So, Here we are creating the secured network between subnets.**


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 2: Launch the Web Server
<a name="LaunchWebServer"></a>
  In this phase, we will launch an EC2 instance for the web server in the public subnet created in Phase 1. The web server will serve as the front end of the e-commerce platform.

## Connect App Server to RDS:
    1. Connect to the App server instance using SSH, and run the below command to install MYSQL Client in App server and connect to it

 **sudo dnf update -y
 sudo dnf install mariadb105**
    2. Connect to the MySQL DB instance. For example, enter the following command. This action lets you connect to the MySQL DB instance using the MySQL client.

Substitute the DB instance endpoint (DNS name) for endpoint, and substitute the master username that you used for admin. Provide the master password that you used when prompted for a password.
  **mysql -h endpoint -P 3306 -u admin -p**

# 3. Set Up the Database Schema:
Once connected to the RDS database, create tables by executing the below SQL script
    **CREATE DATABASE EcommerceDB;
    USE EcommerceDB;
    CREATE TABLE Products (
     ProductID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     Description TEXT,
     Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
    );
    CREATE TABLE Users (
     UserID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     Password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );
    CREATE TABLE Orders (
     OrderID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     UserID INT,
     TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
     OrderDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
    );**

Once Executed, confirm whether the table is created or not.
